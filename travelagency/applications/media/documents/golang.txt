Week 1: Mastering Go Basics
Day 1-2: Go Environment and Basic Syntax
Setup: Install Go, setup your development environment, and familiarize yourself with the Go workspace.
Hello World: Write your first Go program.
Syntax: Learn about variables, basic types, and control structures (if, switch, loops).
Day 3-4: Functions, Packages, and Error Handling
Functions: How to define and use functions, including parameters, return values, and anonymous functions.
Packages: Understand how to use and create packages in Go.
Error Handling: Learn Go's approach to handling errors using the error type.
Day 5: Data Structures
Arrays and Slices: Learn the difference between arrays and slices and how to manipulate them.
Maps: Understand how to use maps for key-value storage.
Structs: Learn about structs and how to define methods on them.
Day 6-7: Interfaces and Concurrency
Interfaces: Understand interfaces for abstracting behavior in Go.
Concurrency: Dive into goroutines and channels for concurrent programming.
Week 2: Advanced Topics and Preparation for Web Development
Day 8-9: Understanding Pointers and Memory Management
Pointers: Learn about pointers and their significance in Go.
Memory Management: Understand how Go handles memory allocation and garbage collection.
Day 10: Modules and Dependency Management
Modules: Get comfortable with creating modules and managing dependencies.
Day 11: Working with Files and JSON
Files: Learn how to read from and write to files.
JSON: Practice encoding and decoding JSON, a crucial skill for web development.
Day 12: Basic Networking Concepts
HTTP Basics: Understand the basics of HTTP methods, status codes, and requests/responses.
Creating a Simple HTTP Server: Learn to create a basic HTTP server in Go.
Day 13-14: Project and Review
Mini-Project: Apply what you've learned by creating a simple project, such as a CLI tool or a basic file parser.
Review and Practice: Spend time reviewing any concepts that aren't clear. Practice by solving problems on sites like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Exercism.io specifically tailored for Go.
Additional Tips:
Daily Practice: Consistency is key. Code every day to reinforce what you've learned.
Use Resources: Leverage books like "The Go Programming Language" by Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan, and online resources like the Go documentation, Go by Example, and the Go Tour.
Engage with the Community: Join forums or communities (e.g., r/golang on Reddit, the Gophers Slack channel) to ask questions, share your progress, and learn from others.
After completing this two-week intensive guide, you'll have a solid foundation in Go programming, ready to tackle web development concepts and start working with PocketBase effectively.
